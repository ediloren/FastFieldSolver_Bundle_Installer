	  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	  ==================================
                Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                        Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General
Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to
some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and
to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can
use it for your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you
modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.  If you link a program with the
library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after
making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1)
copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which
gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
free library.  If the library is modified by someone else and
passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is
not the original version, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies
distributing free software will individually obtain patent
licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into
proprietary software.  To prevent this, we have made it clear
that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for
utility programs.  This license, the GNU Library General Public
License, applies to certain designated libraries.  This license
is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in
full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the
ordinary license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries
is that they blur the distinction we usually make between
modifying or adding to a program and simply using it.  Linking a
program with a library, without changing the library, is in some
sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a
utility program or application program.  However, in a textual
and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General
Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote
software sharing, because most developers did not use the
libraries.  We concluded that weaker conditions might promote
sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive
the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status
of the libraries themselves.  This Library General Public
License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to
use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of
such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated
in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards
changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is
that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the
library".  The former contains code derived from the library,
while the latter only works together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the
ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.

                GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Library General Public License (also called "this
License").  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or
work which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus
any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used
to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The
act of running a program using the Library is not restricted,
and output from such a program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
the Library does.
  
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as
part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General
Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the
Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer
to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General
Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a
newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public
License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead
if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.
 
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
copy the source code from the same place satisfies the
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work
of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a
"work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore
covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work
may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source
code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if
the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not
precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small
inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of
the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is
legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section
6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the
Library itself.
 
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile
or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and
distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own
use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this
License.  If the work during execution displays copyright
notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
that you distribute.
 
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
of the work based on the Library and of the other library
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to
modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library
(or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on
it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on
the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or
modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You
may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
 
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to
apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on
consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
Library does not specify a license version number, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible
with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two
goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
generally.

                           NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free
software that everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do
so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,
alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the
library.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each
source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.



wxWidgets License
------------------------------


Preamble
========

The licensing of the wxWidgets library is intended to protect the wxWidgets
library, its developers, and its users, so that the considerable investment
it represents is not abused.

Under the terms of the wxWidgets Licence, you as a user are not
obliged to distribute wxWidgets source code with your products, if you
distribute these products in binary form. However, you are prevented from
restricting use of the library in source code form, or denying others the
rights to use or distribute wxWidgets library source code in the way
intended.

The wxWidgets Licence establishes the copyright for the code and related
material, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors
for this or derived code.

The core distribution of the wxWidgets library contains files
under two different licences:

- Most files are distributed under the GNU Library General Public
  Licence, version 2, with the special exception that you may create and
  distribute object code versions built from the source code or modified
  versions of it (even if these modified versions include code under a
  different licence), and distribute such binaries under your own
  terms.

- Most core wxWidgets manuals are made available under the "wxWidgets
  Free Documentation Licence", which allows you to distribute modified
  versions of the manuals, such as versions documenting any modifications
  made by you in your version of the library. However, you may not restrict
  any third party from reincorporating your changes into the original
  manuals.

Other relevant files:

- licence.txt: a statement that the wxWidgets library is
  covered by the GNU Library General Public Licence, with an
  exception notice for binary distribution.

- licendoc.txt: the wxWidgets Documentation Licence.

- lgpl.txt: the text of the GNU Library General Public Licence.

- gpl.txt: the text of the GNU General Public Licence, which is
  referenced by the LGPL.

  EXCEPTION NOTICE

  1. As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
  permission for additional uses of the text contained in this release of
  the library as licenced under the wxWindows Library Licence, applying
  either version 3.1 of the Licence, or (at your option) any later version of
  the Licence as published by the copyright holders of version
  3.1 of the Licence document.

  2. The exception is that you may use, copy, link, modify and distribute
  under your own terms, binary object code versions of works based
  on the Library.

  3. If you copy code from files distributed under the terms of the GNU
  General Public Licence or the GNU Library General Public Licence into a
  copy of this library, as this licence permits, the exception does not
  apply to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid misleading anyone as
  to the status of such modified files, you must delete this exception
  notice from such code and/or adjust the licensing conditions notice
  accordingly.

  4. If you write modifications of your own for this library, it is your
  choice whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications. 
  If you do not wish that, you must delete the exception notice from such
  code and/or adjust the licensing conditions notice accordingly.

		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions. 

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version. 

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.



GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
------------------------------

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.



MinGW-w64 runtime licensing
------------------------------

This program or library was built using MinGW-w64 and statically
linked against the MinGW-w64 runtime. Some parts of the runtime
are under licenses which require that the copyright and license
notices are included when distributing the code in binary form.
These notices are listed below.

FIXME: Cephes math lib
Copyright (C) 1984-1998 Stephen L. Moshier

It sounds vague, but as to be found at
<http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html>, it gives an
impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit
permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So
probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a
permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files
in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the
version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming
from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.
