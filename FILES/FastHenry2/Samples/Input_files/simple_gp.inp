* A FastHenry example using a reference plane
*  This example defines an L shaped trace above a ground plane which 
*  has a return path through the plane

*  Set the units for all following dimensions
.units mils
*
* Define ground plane and nodes to reference later
*
*  First define 3 corners of the plane, in clockwise or counter-cw order
g1 x1 = 0     y1 = 0     z1 = 0
+  x2 = 1000  y2 = 0     z2 = 0
+  x3 = 1000  y3 = 1000  z3 = 0
*     thickness:
+  thick = 1.2
*     discretization:
+  seg1 = 20 seg2 = 20
*     nodes to reference later:
+  nin  (800,800,0)
+  nout (0,200,0)

* Some defaults to model skin effects
.default nwinc=8 nhinc=1
*
* L shaped trace over ground plane
*
* The nodes
N1 x=0 y=200 z=1.5
N2 x=800 y=200 z=1.5
N3 x=800 y=800 z=1.5

* The elements connecting the nodes
E1 N1 N2 w=8 h=1
E2 N2 N3 w=8 h=1

* Short together the end of the L shaped trace (N3) and its corresponding
*  point on the ground plane directly beneath (nin)
.equiv nin n3

* compute loop inductance from beginning of L (N1) to its corresponding 
*   point directly underneath (nout)
.external N1 nout

* Compute impedance matrix for one very low frequency (essentially DC) 
*   and one very high frequency
.freq fmin=1e-1 fmax=1e19 ndec=0.05
