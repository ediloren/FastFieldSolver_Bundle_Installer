* A FastHenry example using a reference plane
*  This example defines an L shaped trace above a ground plane 
*  with many holes.  This is nearly the same as simple_gp.inp plus the holes.

*  Set the units for all following dimensions
.units mils
*
* Define ground plane and nodes to reference later
*
*  First define 3 corners of the plane, in clockwise or counter-cw order
g1 x1 = 0     y1 = 0     z1 = 0
+  x2 = 1000  y2 = 0     z2 = 0
+  x3 = 1000  y3 = 1000  z3 = 0
*     thickness:
+  thick = 1.2
*     discretization:
+  seg1 = 51 seg2 = 51
*     nodes to reference later:
+  nin  (900,920,0)
+  nout (0,200,0)
+  hole rect (100,100,0,300,300,0)
+  hole rect (400,100,0,600,300,0)
+  hole rect (700,100,0,900,300,0)
+
+  hole rect (100,400,0,300,600,0)
+  hole circle (500,500,0,110)
+  hole rect (700,400,0,900,600,0)
+
+  hole rect (100,700,0,300,900,0)
+  hole rect (400,700,0,600,900,0)
+  hole rect (700,700,0,900,900,0)
+
*  rectangular hole that overlaps circular hole
+  hole rect (480,200,0,520,800,0)

* Some defaults to model skin effects
.default nwinc=8 rw=1

* L shaped trace over ground plane
*
* The nodes
N1 x=0 y=200 z=1.5
N2 x=900 y=200 z=1.5
N3 x=900 y=920 z=1.5

* The elements connecting the nodes
E1 N1 N2 w=8 h=1
E2 N2 N3 w=8 h=1

* Short together the end of the L shaped trace (N3) and its corresponding
*  point on the ground plane directly beneath (nin)
.equiv nin n3

* compute loop inductance from beginning of L (N1) to its corresponding 
*   point directly underneath (nout)
.external N1 nout

* Do it for one very low frequency (essentially DC) and one very high frequency
.freq fmin=1e-1 fmax=1e19 ndec=0.05
