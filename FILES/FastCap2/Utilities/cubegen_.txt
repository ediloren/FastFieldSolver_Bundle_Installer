cubegen_c - Di Lorenzo Enrico   3/Apr/1998

Works like standard MIT cubegen utility as described in fastcap 
user's guide par. 2.8 but -n option has been replaced with 
-nx, -ny, -nz. They allow the number of panels per cube edge's
specification along the three cube axis. -nx refers to 
fr/bl - top/bottom edges, -ny to fl/br - bl/fr edges,
-nz to fl/br - top/bottom edges. 
(A new disRect C function has been written for this purpose; 
see source file for details.)  
The main use of this utility is the generation of structures
which are stretched along one direction (e.g. wires).
