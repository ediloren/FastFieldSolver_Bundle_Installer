convertHenry - Enrico Di Lorenzo 3/Apr/1998

This utility translates a FastHenry input files into FastCap ones. 
Every segment is converted into a cube like the ones generated 
with cubegen_c, but respecting wx, wy, wz specifications (that is,
segment's spatial orientation is kept). Then segments electrically 
connected (also with .equiv statments) and belonging to the same
port are stored together in group files; there will be as many 
group files as ports in the source file. A FastCap list file will 
include all group file names as well as a comment line showing 
the name of the two nodes from which the port is made up in the 
FastHenry file. 
You can also specify a custom dielectic constant for the homogeneous
medium in which panels are (of course, you have to insert manually 
medium discontinuities, because input file doesn't contain such
informations), a edge to inner panel width ratio and a 
discretization step. The latter is defined as the maximum length 
of a panel's side. Note that segment's end faces are always 
removed, except when -f option is specified.
Moreover, you can decide to replace any segment with any other
structure you have defined in a FastCap file; you only have 
to specify a string of characters which are included into 
the segment's name (you can decide, for istance, to substitute 
every segment containing the string 'ball'; then the segments
'ball_1a' , 'bouncing_ball' and so on will be replaced with 
the panels described in file you have chosen, maybe 'sphere.neu'). 
Remember that to the contents of your file will be given an offset
corresponding to the spatial position of the FIRST node of the 
segment which is being replaced. 
Unfortunately, I was in a hurry when I wrote this routine, so 
neither uniform nor nonuniform gnd planes are recognized by 
the software (they are simply ignored); maybe later on..
