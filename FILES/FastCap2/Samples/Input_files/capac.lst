*
* capacitor example 
*
* this parallel plates capacitor is embedded in an homogeneous dielectric 
* 
* note that although the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor of 1mx1m
* and separation distance of 0.1m can be approximately computed as e0/0.1F = 0.089nF,
* this formula completely neglets stray field effects. 
* From FastCap2, you get the real value of the capacitance, which includes a mutual
* capacitance between the plates AND a stray capacitance towards infinity (zero potential).
* For further details, see FastCap manual. 
*
* REMARK: you have to generate the plates and dielectric geometry, before being
* able to lauch FastCap, using the cubegen_ command with the options specified
* in the comments here below.
