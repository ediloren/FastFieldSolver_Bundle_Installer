==================

Version 6.0.0, 2017/08/24
- LGPL version

Version 5.5.2, 2015/01/19
- Allowed running in pure console mode on Linux
  without the need of any DISPLAY

Version 5.5.1, 2014/09/08
- Improved Floating License mechanism
- 64 bit version ported to MinGW-w64

Version 5.5.0, 2014/06/30
- Multi-processor version

Version 5.0.7, 2014/03/31
- Update to wxWidgets 3.0

Version 5.0.6, 2013/12/12
- Improved timing in connection to floating License Server,
  to avoid loosing connection in high load conditions

Version 5.0.5, 2013/11/28
- Fixing corner case issue in numerical potential evaluation

Version 5.0.4, 2013/08/09
- Enhanced flexibility on licensing

Version 5.0.3, 2013/06/14
- Added support for Win 64bits

Version 5.0.2, 2013/03/12
- Added 2D capacitance solver two-levels pre-conditioner support.
- Added the Single Input File capability
- Updated and changed exit status codes for both Automation
  and Console modes
- Added console mode options:
  o print only the version
  o open only the help
  o print usage

Version 5.0.1, 2013/03/11
- Added 2D capacitance solver complex permittivity support.

Version 5.0.0, 2013/01/11
- Adding 2D capacitance solver capabilities.
- Fixed a bug when dumping charge densities, in case there were conductors
  in contact with different dielectrics.

Version 4.0.5, 2013/01/07
- Minor stabilization fixes

Version 4.0.0, 2012/12/21
- Main Linux porting version
- Improved two-levels pre-conditioner, both in terms of conditioning (less iterations needed
  to reach solution convergence) and of capability to build the preconditioner where
  the previous version failed and reverted to Jacobi preconditioner.
  In particular, the improved pre-conditioner is able to address ill-conditioned geometries
  with extreme geometrical ratios

Version 3.5.0, 2012/12/04
- Added command line option '-b' allowing launching FasterCap as a console application

Version 3.1.1, 2012/12/03
- Fixed issue when the maximum number of GMRES iterations is reached

Version 3.1.0, 2012/11/19
- Fixed issue with the division of stretched (long and thin) quadrilateral panels,
  causing in some cases many very small triangles to appear in the refinement
- Changed the warning message for thin panels, so the user is notified,
  also in non-verbose mode, if the thin panels are in the input file or
  created during the triangularization
- Added check for dummy dielectric surfaces (having the same dielectric constant
  on both sides). In this case FasterCap issues warning and skips the surface
- Fixed issue in setting the verbose mode, that caused verbose information to appear
  only in the next run and not in the current

Version 3.0.3, 2012/05/24
- Support for complex permittivity to allow handling of lossy dielectric mediums

Version 2.0, 2011/11/25
- Out-of-core capability
- Charge densities dump in FastModel compatibile format

Version 1.2, 2010/12/18
- Enhanced version supporting Automation

Version 1.0, 2010/07/22
- Creation
