* 2D - circular wire over gnd plane, embedded in lossy dielectric
*
* Benchmark test against analytical solution = 107.8pF -j81.31uS/m at 100MHz
*
* Input parameters are:
*
* diameter = 1.0, distance of the center of the wire from the gnd plane = 2.0
* Re(eps)=4, tan(delta)=1.2e-3, f = 1e8
* (it follows that eps = 4 - j 2*PI*f*e0*Re(eps)*tan(delta) = 4 -j3.016e6)
