* 2D - three line bus in layered dielectric
*
* capacitance should be about:
* C11 = 222.8 pF/m, C12 = -14.9 pF/m
*
* REMARK: result is different from the paper for high discretization levels 
* (we get about C11 = 228.2 pF/M, C12 = -5.3 pF/m)
*
* To improve convergence, set '-d' to 0.1 (gaps are thin)

* and/or arbitrary dielectric media", IEEE Transactions on MTT, Vol. 42, No. 3, Mar 1994
