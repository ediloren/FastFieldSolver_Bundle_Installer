* 2D - Coated coaxial cable, a=1 internal radius, b=1.5 diel interface, c=2 external radius
* Analytic capacitance capacitance is C1*C2/(C1+C2) where
* C1 = 2*pi*e0*er1/ln(b/a) = 274.4 pF/m, C2 = 2*pi*e0*er2/ln(c/b) = 193.4 pf/m
* It follows C = 113.4 pF/m
* Note that in this input file the discretization is finer (40 sections per circle)
* so actual capacitance is closer to the theorical one
