* Sphere inside cube
* 
*
* Capacitance of a unit radius sphere inside a cube with side=2.5 should be 7.915462 * 4 * pi * e0 / 2.5 = 352.3 pF
* (this is the C11 element of the Maxwell capacitance matrix, that is equal to C11' + C12',
* where C11' should be zero since the cube is completely contained into the sphere)
* REMARK: this is not coincident with the result from the paper. Seems a typo in the results formula,
* in which the normalized value must be scaled by b=2.5
