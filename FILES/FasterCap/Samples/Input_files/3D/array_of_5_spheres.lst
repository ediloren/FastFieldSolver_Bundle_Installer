* Array of five spheres
*
*
* Spheres have unit radius, surface to surface distance is one meter;
* Total capacitance of the center sphere should be 143pF, its self-capacitance 
* should be 52pF, and the capacitances between the center sphere 
* and spheres next in line should be C12 = 37.5pF and C13 = 7.88pF.
