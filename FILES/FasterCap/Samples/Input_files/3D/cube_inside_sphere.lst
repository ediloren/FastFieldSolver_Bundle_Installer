* Cube inside sphere
* 
*
* Capacitance of a cube with side=0.4 inside a unit radius sphere should be 0.361047 * 4 * pi * e0 = 40.17 pF
* (this is the C11 element of the Maxwell capacitance matrix, that is equal to C11' + C12',
* where C11' should be zero since the cube is completely contained into the shpere)
