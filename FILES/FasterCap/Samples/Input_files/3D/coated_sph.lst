* fastcap surface list file for two concentric spherical shells
* - inner is a conductor surface
* - outer is a dielectric/dielectric (coating/air) interface
*
* By Gauss law, the capacitance is 4*pi*e0*er*a*b/(b-a(1-er))
* where er is the relative permittivity;
* a is the conductor radius; and b is the dielectric shell radius.
* Expected capacitance is: 148.4e-12 F
*
* radius 1 shell is the conductor
