* in this case the outperm reference point (0.5, 0.5, 0.6), referencing the relative
* permittivity 2.0, is inside the dielectric cube. Since a cube is a convex solid, all
* the panels composing the cube 'see' the 2.0 permittivity on the internal side.

* in this case instead we tried to specify as outperm reference point the air
* around the cube (relative permittivity 1.0). In principle this is valid; however,
* since external / internal side of the panels is evaluated w.r.t. the position
* of the reference point on panel by panel basis, for some panels this choice is wrong.
* The reason is that in FasterCap (or FastCap2) there is no concept of
* topology of a surface, so the SW has no way to tell which is the internal/external side
* of an object on a surface basis. Please consider that this is anyway difficult in general,
* in case of open surfaces like the ones allowed as dielectric interfaces in FasterCap,
* even if you keep topology information with the shape.
* If you uncomment the following line and comment out the previous 'D' definition,
* you will see that the result changes, while you might have expected it not to,
* if you had naively applied the intuitive concept of internal and external sides.
* Specifically, only the bottom panel of the cube is correctly referenced, while the top and
* side panels 'think' that the reference point is on the opposite side w.r.t. what we wanted.
