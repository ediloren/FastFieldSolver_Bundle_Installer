* Cube over GND plane
* 
*
* Capacitance of the unit cube over gnd plane should be 0.8424 * 4 * pi * e0 = 93.73 pF
* (this is the C11 element of the Maxwell capacitance matrix, that is equal to C11' + C12',
* that is the sum of the capacitance of the cube towards infinity plus the capacitance
* of the cube towards the ground plane, i.e. the capacitance of the cube when the
* ground plane has the same zero potential as infinity)
