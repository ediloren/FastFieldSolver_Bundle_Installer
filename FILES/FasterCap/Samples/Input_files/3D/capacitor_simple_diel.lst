* Simple parallel plate capacitor with inhomogeneous dielectric
* 
*
* This capacitor is made by two square metal contacts
* filled with an inhomogeneous dielectric medium
*
* If fringing fields are neglected, the capacitance as per analytical formula
* is the series of two capacitors: the first capacitor has capacitance
* C1 = e0*er1*S/ (d/2), the second C2 = e0*er2*S/ (d/2), where S is
* the surface of the armors and d is their distance.
* In this case S = 1, d = 0.01, er1 = 1, er2 = 2; therefore
* C1 = 8.854e-12 * 1 * 1 / 0.0005 = 1.77e-8
* C2 = 8.854e-12 * 2 * 1 / 0.0005 = 3.54e-8
* therefore C = C1 // C2 = 1.18e-8
*
* Remark: given the high geometrical ratio 1:1000 between the plate side and
* the plate distance, for proper solution convergence you need to set FasterCap's
* '-d' parameter to 0.1 or lower values.
