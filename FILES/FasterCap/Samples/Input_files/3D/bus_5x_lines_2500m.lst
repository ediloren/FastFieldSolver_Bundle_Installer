* Bus made of 5x lines 2500m long
* 
* This example breaks the two-levels preconditioner as well as FastCap2.
* There are five very long and thin lines; local interactions are important,
* and trying to uniformly divide a cubic region in which the conductors
* are contained in a hierarchy of cubes leads to a very large numer of *empty*
* cubes
*
* To solve in FasterCap, use the Jacobi preconditioner only
