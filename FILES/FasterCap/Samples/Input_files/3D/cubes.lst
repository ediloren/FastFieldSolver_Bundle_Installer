0 Array of two cubes, in air
*
* Capacitance of the two cubes capacitor should be 0.51 * 4 * pi * e0 = 56.75 pF
* for the conditions dx = 2.0 and unit cubes a = b = 1
* (this is the C11' part of the C11 element of the Maxwell capacitance matrix, that is equal to C11' + C12'.
* This is the capacitance of one cube, when both cubes are at the same potential)
