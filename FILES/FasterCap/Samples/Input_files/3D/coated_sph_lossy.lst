*
* list file for a 1m radius conductive sphere 
* embedded in a lossy dielectric medium, thickness 1m
* - inner is a conductor surface
* - outer is a dielectric/dielectric (coating/air) interface
*
* By Gauss law, the capacitance is 4*pi*e0*er*a*b/(b-a(1-er))
* where er is the relative permittivity, that can be complex valued;
* a is the conductor radius; and b is the dielectric shell radius.
* Expected capacitance and conductance are: 148.4e-12 -7.42e-13j
*
* radius 1 shell is the conductor
