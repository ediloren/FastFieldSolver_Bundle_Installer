* Simple parallel plate capacitor
* 
*
* This capacitor is made by two square metal contacts
* embedded in an homogeneous dielectric medium
*
* If fringing fields are neglected, the capacitance as per analytical formula
* is e0*er*S/d where S is the surface of the armors and d is their distance.
* In this case S = 1, d = 0.01, er = 1, therefore C = 8.854e-12 * 1 * 1 / 0.001 = 8.854e-9
*
* Remark: given the high geometrical ratio 1:1000 between the plate side and
* the plate distance, for proper solution convergence you need to set FasterCap's
* '-d' parameter to 0.1 or lower values.
